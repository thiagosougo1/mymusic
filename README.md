### token-provider

Download the .jar from the following link to compile the token application

To create valid tokens, use the following endpoint:

```
ENDPOINT: /api/v1/token
METODO: POST
BODY: 
{ 
    "data": {
        "name": "fulano"
    }
}
RETORNO: 201 Created
{
    "12321312321312"
}
```

For token validation use the following endpoint:

```
ENDPOINT: /api/v1/token/authorizer
METODO: POST
BODY: 
{ 
    "data": {
        "name": "fulano",
        "token": "12321312321312"
    }
}
RETORNO: 201 Created
{
    "ok"
}
```

# Database

To test the database use the following steps:

To help the development of the API, the initial structure has a pre-defined and populated database.

Modeling:

Attention:
Id fields using GUID map to string due to complexity in compatibility with Java's native UUID.

Tip:
It is not necessary, but it is possible to use a tool to open and view the MyMusic.db file in an easier way, such as:
